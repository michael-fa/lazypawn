# lazypawn
Just a self-made collection of also self-made include files that helped me through the times of scripting.<br>
Lazypawn includes (no pun intended):
* Vehicle functions
* Time handling
* Player handling
* Utilities

## About
I wasn't really aiming to publish this collection, but maybe someone finds this useful some day.
Thus there's no awesome documentation.
Just take a look inside each file. Comments are made for everyone to understand what each function does.
