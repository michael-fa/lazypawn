# lazypawn
Just a self made collection of also selfmade include files that helped me through the times of scripting.<br>
Includes:
* Vehicle functions
* Time handling
* Player handling
* Utilities

## About
I wasn't really aiming to publish this collection, but maybe someone finds this useful some day.
Thus is there no awesome documentation.
Just take a look inside each file. Comments are made for everyone to understand what each function does.
